Type “sudo chmod a+rwx /path/to/file” into the terminal, 
replacing “/path/to/file” with the file you want to give permissions to everyone for, 
and press “Enter.” 

You can also use the command “sudo chmod -R a+rwx /path/to/folder” to give permissions to a folder and every file and folder inside it.
